## How To run application üîß

#### Don't forget to create a virtual environment and activate.

From your command line, first clone property-deals:

# Go into the repository
cd property-deals
```

Then you can install the dependencies using PIP:

### On Linux and Mac
```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pip3 install -r requirememts.txt

# Start development server
$ python3 run.py
```

### On Windows
Use Powershell, Command Prompt or Windows Terminal

```bash
# Install dependencies
PS> pip install -r requirememts.txt

# Start development server
PS> python run.py

```

##Setting Up the Database
Once you run the application for the first time, it will automatically create an SQlite database file if that's what is configured. 
Otherwise, you have to create a database. A Postgres database is preferred but feel free to use whichever you want.


### Connection String
In your application, you have to configure the flask application to use the Postgres database.
Your connection string format should be like this: 
`postgresql+psycopg2://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`
You have to set a password for connecting to Postgres or else Valentina Studio won't connect.
Here is an example on a connection string `postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/property_deals`
