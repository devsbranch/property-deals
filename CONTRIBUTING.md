## Request Support

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or just need clarification about something:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/devsbranch/property-deals/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will lable the issue.
* Someone will try to have a response soon.
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the issue will be closed. If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.

## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/devsbranch/property-deals/issues
* Include *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
* Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will label the issue.
* A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no repro steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
* If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#contribute-code).
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.
* `critical` issues may be left open, depending on perceived immediacy and severity, even past the 30 day deadline.

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/devsbranch/property-deals/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Please try to be clear about why existing features and alternatives would not work for you.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will label the issue.
* The project team will evaluate the feature request, possibly asking you more questions to understand its purpose and any relevant requirements. If the issue is closed, the team will convey their reasoning and suggest an alternative path forward.
* If the feature request is accepted, it will be marked for implementation with `feature-accepted`, which can then be done by either by a core team member or by anyone in the community who wants to contribute code.

Note: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.

## Project Setup

So you want contribute some code! That's great! This project uses GitHub Pull Requests to manage contributions, so [read up on how to fork a GitHub project and file a PR](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) if you've never done it before. 
.

If you want to go the usual route and run the project locally, though:

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (which comes with `pip`) installed on your computer.

* [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Fork the project](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork)

Then in your terminal:
* `cd path/to/your/clone`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python run.py`

and you should be ready to go!
